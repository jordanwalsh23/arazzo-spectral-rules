The Arazzo Specification v1.0.0 has now been published [here](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/latest.html).

This list of [Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral) rules can be run to help ensure that documents created adhere to the specification.

## Quick Start

- Browse to https://postman-toolbox.postmansolutions.com/governance-playground and copy your Arazzo document in the JSON/YAML section.

- Copy the rules from spectral-rules.yaml into the Spectral Ruleset Section.

- Delete the custom function if it's there.

- Click Validate.

Your document should now validate against the spec.

## Questions / Feedback

This is a work in progress. Feel free to submit a pull request if you would like to contribute to the rules.
